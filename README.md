# Simple-Banking-System
This program is an simplified version example of usual banking system. It allows you to create a new account with new card number and pin. Then, you can enter your account with your card number and pin. If you are worried about what will happen to your account when program is closed, don't worry! It records your information in a database so you can enter your account when you run again the program without creating any account. If you want to take a look at the database I will share a comment block in the beginning of the code bunch so you can take a look at database with uncommenting those lines. 'None' values represent the IDs, second values represent the card numbers, third values represent the PIN and fourth values represent how much money this account has. Furthermore, you can transfer money among the accounts. Of course you can't transfer money that has a value of greater than you have. If you decide to close an account, after entering your account you can do that also. Let's have a look at this project!
